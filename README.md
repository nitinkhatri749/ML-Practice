# Data Preprocessing-
Before starting we should have basic knowledge of Numpy, Pandas & sklearn.
Before starting with ML, we have to learn how to prepare data and we call it Data_Preprocessing.
Data Preprocessing is used to take care of missing values in our data.
We use Preprocessing module of sklearn to do this job.
